Star Wars Battle Simulator

Welcome to the Star Wars Battle Simulator! This Python-based game lets you choose your favorite hero or villain from the Star Wars universe and engage in epic battles.

    Unique Abilities: Each character has multiple unique abilities, each with its own damage output and cooldown period.
    Turn-Based Combat: The battle is turn-based, with each character attacking or using abilities on their turn.
    Cooldown Management: Abilities have cooldowns, so plan your actions wisely!
    Random Opponents: Face off against randomly selected enemies to keep each battle exciting and unpredictable.
